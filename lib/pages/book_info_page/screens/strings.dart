      """THE HOMERIC HYMNS are a collection of thirty-three Greek poems composed in the old Epic style. They range in length from 3 to 500 lines. The shortest of these are brief invocations which served as preludes to longer festival recitations of epic. The largest four are complete epic narrative poems in themselves.

The dating and authorship of the Hymns is complex. Greek writers assigned several authors including Homer, Pamphos (Hymn to Demeter), and Cynaethus of Chios (Hymn to Apollo). However they are now regarded as a largely anonymous collection of works.
The majority of the collection, including the longer hymns, dates from the C7th - C6th B.C. A few of the shorter poems are clearly Hellenistic, and the Hymn to Ares was probably composed in Roman times. Hesiod, Homeric Hymns, Epic Cycle, Homerica. Translated by Evelyn-White, H G. Loeb Classical Library Volume 57. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1914.

The Evelyn-White volume is no longer in print but second-hand copies might be obtained from Amazon.com sellers (click on image right for details). In addition to the Homeric Hymns the volume also contains Hesiod's Theogony, Works and Days, Shield of Heracles, Hesiodic fragments, and fragments of the Epic Cycle poems.

Loeb has now replaced this volume with three new translations, one containing the works Hesiod, another fragments of early Greek Epic, and the third the Homeric Hymns and Homerica. These, as well as several other more recent translations and academic commentaries, appear in the booklist (left below).""";

      "Homeric Hymns, collection of 34 ancient Greek poems in heroic hexameters, all addressed to gods. Though ascribed in antiquity to Homer, the poems actually differ widely in date and are of unknown authorship. Most end with an indication that the singer intends to begin another song, therefore suggesting the preludes used by rhapsodists in beginning their recitals of heroic poetry";
